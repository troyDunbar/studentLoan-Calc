# studentLoan-Calc

During the internship at Envestnet|MoneyGuide I worked in a group of four, with 2 front end developers including myself,
a back end developer, and a technical analyst on creating a web appliaction to calculate efficent ways to pay off particular student loans,
as well as general indexes to invest into.
