# studentLoan-Calc

During the internship at Envestnet|MoneyGuide I worked in a group of four, with 2 front end developers including myself,
a back end developer, and a technical analyst on creating a web appliaction to calculate efficent ways to pay off particular student loans,
as well as general indexes to invest into.

Working through the Angular framework, with Bootstrap support the team and I were able to create a strong single page application, that updates based on the data the user supplies, and makes API requests without refreshing the page, with dynamic Highcahrts and numerical displays.
